<p>The idea for the app came out few months back. Few months ago, me and my buddy was in a chaotic process trying to land a summer internship. We went to all the networking session, trying to get an interview. Besides networking, one of the benefits from the networking session is free food. As college student, we don't have time to cook so the meals come in handy. As we were walking back to the parking lot, I came back with the idea for an app that can sum up all of the events on campus that have free food. And with that, the app is made</p>
